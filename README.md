# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help Louise develop a Kickstarter campaign strategy to fund her play in a local theater. Using data from past Kickstarter campaigns we hope to provide clarity to Louise on how other Kickstarter campaigns have fared based on their launch dates and funding goals. Recently, Louise was able to launch her Kickstarter campaign and come close to the goal funding in a short amount of time. This iteration of the analysis is to help predict the outcome based on dates and goal amounts.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The data analyzed contains Kickstarter campaigns from 2007 through 2017, filtered to only contain a parent category of theater. The theater category is the most relevant category for Louise's play. The data shows the month of May has the highest count of successful Kickstarter campaigns, when compared to any other month. The count of failed and canceled campaigns in May do not show the dramatic increase that successful campaigns do. Based on this information, it is recommended that Louise launches her Kickstarter campaign in the month of May, if at all possible.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Using Kickstarter campaign data from 2007 through 2017, filtered for the subcategory of plays, an analysis was performed to determine success rates of Kickstarter campaigns based on financial goals. Louise had originally thought the play would need roughly $12,000 generated through Kickstarter. While the anlaysis shows that plays in this financial range do have a higher percentage of success than failed, it is recommended to reduce the budget to roughly $5,000. Plays with a budget of $5,000 or lower have a much higher percent of success, and much lower precent of failure, when getting funded on Kickstarter. The higher funding goal will have a success rate of roughly 54%, and the lower goal will have a success rate of 73%.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
